- 👋 Hi, I’m @ESPP-ZDT
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming overall, and getting an IT job! I'm learning mostly by practise, making games. I've used pygame, kivy with python,
learned some docker, sql, basic app creating like django react and other stuff along the way, I'd love to learn anything which would benefit me in the future!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning KaboomJS Javascipt library
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! everything is cool!
- 📫 How to reach me? just write me an email!
